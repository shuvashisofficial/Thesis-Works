This repository includes a collection of practice notebooks created during the initial phases of my BSc thesis, serving as a foundation for the structured and comprehensive research that followed. These notebooks document my journey through exploratory data analysis, model development, and testing of various methodologies. They showcase the process of preparing datasets, implementing statistical and machine learning models, and experimenting with optimization techniques to refine analytical accuracy and performance. Specific works include exploratory iterations like 1ST_THESIS_WORK, where initial data insights were derived, to more advanced stages such as 8th_THESIS_WORK, which integrated findings and prepared for final thesis submissions. Additionally, specialized experiments, such as ARIMA models for time-series analysis and unique visual explorations in Butterfly, are included. Together, these practice notebooks highlight my learning process, the application of data science techniques, and the development of a solid research foundation for my BSc thesis.
